In that repository I'm going to solve as many quadratic formulas I can in the fastet time I can.
I'm going to do that in a pretty odd way, to make myself learn and use the next techs:

1. queues (activemq)
2. cache (redis)
3. fast serialization. Will start with regular, json serializaion, and improve to Google's
Protobug.
4. Few micro services, in different languages. I think it will be C#, Java, python, go and
maybe javascript. Each service will do something different that is in charge of the flow
of the calculations.
5. Benchmarks. I am going to measure myself in each of the parts of that application. That way
I can observe how each of improvement is making a difference.

Main flow:
1. Read the quadratic Equations from some csv allong side their pre calculated solutions. 
Send them to the applicaion flow, and compare the results with the pre calculated solution.
(Bonus: read those equations from a paper AI).

2.
