# QuadraticFormula

Original text is shown in branch release/multi-languate-implementation.

Here I will list thing and learned and technologies I used:

Golang:
	Testing
	Logging
	Using interfaces
	Error handling (using panic and recover, returning errors)

Windows batch:
	Cleaning, testing and building with stop on first error.

To be able and run with each of the services, we should run "bin\activemq start"
